# SPAREROOM AVAILABLE ROOMS
A Python code for extracting data from [spareroom](https://www.spareroom.co.uk) and storing the information in a mysql database. Spareroom does not have an API, so I parse the website with Bueatifulsoupe package of python and clean it in a simple way to only include my preferences. It asks the user the number of rooms, and the location they want to look for.
